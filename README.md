# WhichGIF
’WhichGIF’ is a one-player game that collects data about GIF’s, such as tags related to GIF. 
The data collected from this app will help suggest or recommend highly relevant GIFs for social-media chatting applications.  
The main purpose of the app is to reduce the cost and the efforts required for labelling/tagging the GIF's manually.
